## 4. Practical Tips

### Booking Trips Using Ctrip and Booking.com

- **Booking.com**: Ideal for hotel reservations. Look for properties with free cancellation options for flexibility.

### Making Payments with Alipay

### Using Google Translate for Language Assistance

### Using Didi for Taxi Services

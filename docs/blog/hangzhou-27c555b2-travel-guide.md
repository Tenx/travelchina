## 4. Practical Tips

### Making Payments with Alipay
- **Alipay** is widely accepted across Hangzhou. You can use it to pay for meals, transportation, and shopping.
  - **Tips**: Link your Alipay account to a Chinese bank account or a foreign credit card for seamless transactions. Ensure you have the app downloaded before your trip.

### Using Google Translate
- **Language Assistance**: Google Translate can be a lifesaver in Hangzhou, where English may not be widely spoken.

### Using Didi for Taxi Services
- **Didi** is China's leading ride-hailing app, functioning similarly to Uber.

### Internet Access and VPN Considerations
